  YouTube channels for learning Russian. 7 brand new YouTubers teaching you the
  mighty Russian
intro: >-
  In the years this project seemed dying or dead (see: [Operation
  War](https://www.rusland1.nl/en/taal/20240507-operatie_oorlog/), 2024) others
  started their new projects to spread the mighty Russian. There was certainly
  no shortage of YouTube channels teaching Russian, but there's always room for
  one more – therefore, also always for more than one. Here are seven pretty new
  ones, worth checking out.

#### Go YouTubers

This site would never have existed without all those Russian teachers (m/f) and vloggers who give their best in front of the camera, and make the results available to everyone. Their clips are inserted here (on many places) with gratitude, and with an encouragement to you (readers and viewers) to support the makers any way you can. Many YouTubers work hard, earn little, and often get harassed and insulted on top of it al.

Here  is the latest generation of brave ones, with of each their most recent video.

####  I love Russian

Love for I love Russian from the very first video (2022, on the [alphabet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrSATfdOpM)) until probably forever. Because of Dasha in particular, because of her background wallpaper, and because this is as Russian as it gets in several aspects. Dasha says sensible things about goals, and speaks with compassion about and to the struggling student (in [How NOT to learn Russian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNF_hXzq5C8), 2024).

<br/>

#### In Russian From Afar

Launched in 2020, brought to you from Vietnam – Afar for most of us indeed. When Sergey talks about [praying for a dead dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL3wVhaj7dA), one might think he has gone mad – but there are worse types of madness, and Sergey doesn’t hurt or harm any creature with this one.

Recommended is the series about Russian writers, with biographical stories on [Bulgakov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHQCKsp-O4), [Dostoevsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyc5AxfYBrE), [Gogol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcE8L-E1Ogs) and [Tolstoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rIudV13AA).

<br/>
<br/>

#### Level Up Your Russian

Started in 2021 (with [Gender of nouns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCLZbwvXNQ8)) and has undoubtedly leveled up since then. Yet, view counts stay behind.  Keep it up.

<br/>
<br/>


#### Lina's Lessons

Introduced before in [Verb Vocabulary](https://www.rusland1.nl/en/taal/20240822-werkwoordenschat/) (2024), Lina ploughs on bravely with her verbs, words and useful phrases.

<br/>
<br/>


#### Practical Russian


Like [In Russian From Afar](https://www.youtube.com/@InRussianFromAfar) not that new actually (started in [2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8OJAwVaX1s)), but too good to leave unmentioned. Starring Natalya, who is easy to love and seems almost too soft and gentle for this world. She wishes everyone and everything [good things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byP9ByWIOUs), and sometimes she feels [sad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpj-yFuDT9w), but she'll never be alone in that. <br/>
Practical tip for intermediate and up: set the speed to 1.25 minimum.

<br/>
<br/>

#### Russian Radio Show

Among other voice jobs, Sergey Griffits worked as a radio DJ, and it's noticeable.  Good voice, dynamic use of it, a delight to listen to. Videos on YouTube since [2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN2r4GdIa00), podcasts on [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/russian-radio-show/id1548767287) and  [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/72rFvi1mggZI79RpTqNpJV?si=a8bfec5e7be64667). If (as planned) we focus more on Russian teaching channels and their makers, Sergey will definitely star in one of the first episodes.

<br/>
<br/>

#### Yaroslava Russian

Active since 2021 (opener: a [tour of the Georgian Museum of Fine Arts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlZLQff9GUs)) and (like Lina's Lessons) previously presented here, in [Learning Russian with News](https://www.rusland1.nl/en/taal/20240622_russisch_leren_met_nieuws/) (2024). The series 'Lets just talk in Russian and become friends' (episodes: [Dengue fever, how I lost my tooth, and other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FgmHHg7JSM), [Birthday, bureaucracy, prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP0J7Z02j5k), [My Winter Favorites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kckvxev51iQ) are a pleasant watch in likeable concept and setting.
