#### President (one of two)

Yeltsin began his political career in the Communist Party, which he later became a vocal critic of. He was elected president of the Russian Federation on June 12, 1991, while the Soviet Union still existed and also had a president: [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev).


<br/>

#### 1991: Yeltsin on a Tank

In August 1991, a coup attempt took place, and Gorbachev was placed under house arrest. Yeltsin took leadership of the resistance against the coup plotters, and (equally or more important) became the face of that resistance. Boris standing atop a tank outside the White House in Moscow.

#### First Post-Soviet President

At the end of that same year, Gorbachev stepped aside (December 25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lPjMh1zpEo), the Soviet Union [dissolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union), and  [Борис Николаевич Ельцин](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%95%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BD%2C_%D0%91%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81_%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87), from the village of [Butka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butka,_Russia), became the first Post-Soviet President.

<br/>

#### 1993: Shooting with a Tank

A power struggle between Yeltsin and the parliament (then the Supreme Soviet) escalated into a crisis and violence in October 1993. In March, the parliament (led by [Ruslan Khasbulatov]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruslan_Khasbulatov)) attempted to impeach Yeltsin; Yeltsin, in turn, announced in September that he was dissolving the parliament and would call for new elections, constitution or not. Parliament declared Yeltsin impeached, and appointed [Alexander Rutskoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Rutskoy) as acting president.

On October 3, clashes broke out in Moscow between pro-parliament demonstrators and troops loyal to Yeltsin. On October 4, Yeltsin ordered the military to storm the White House (where the parliament was holed up). If standing on a tank didn't make some impression already, having a tank fire surely did.

#### 1994: Unstable

While the country was searching for lasting stability, the president seemed to lose his— usually after having had a drink, or more than one. Even on state visits, including in Washington. And in Iceland, he appeared [missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiVyd7ORKPU) (1994).

With a weak economy, rampant corruption, and high crime rates, a drunk president was the last thing the country needed. It did, however, provide plenty of laughs— like the footage with Bill Clinton and a dancing Yeltsin.

#### 1999: Stepping Aside

On New Year's Eve 1999, Yeltsin surprised everyone with a speech announcing his resignation. "Я ухожу. Я сделал все, что мог" – I am leaving. I have done all I could. "Лучшее решение для России – иметь нового президента" - the best decision for Russia is to have a new president. He handed over power to a then-little-known politician: Vladimir Putin.

#### 2007: State Funeral

After stepping down, Yeltsin largely withdrew from public life. He worked on his memoirs ([Midnight Diaries](https://archive.org/details/midnightdiaries00yelt/page/388/mode/2up)) and spent time with his family. After several years of health issues, he passed away on April 23, 2007, from heart failure at the age of 76.

Yeltsin's [funeral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDsCUqrVN_k) was conducted according to Orthodox Christian traditions, a first in Russia since the Soviet era. The respect he commanded (despite a controversial legacy), was also evident in the attendance of world leaders like George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Helmut Kohl, and Lech Wałęsa.
